**OrbitViewerPlugin**

Constructor takes options and wsWrapperIn. Default settings are found in
./src/config.json but some of the settings can be overridden by passing
dictionary to "options".

Because some of the plugins might use the same websocket connection, the
constructor gives an option to reuse existing connection.

If the source code is not descriptive enough, give a hint and I will fix the
issue.
